In this lab, we learned the concepts of stack by making stack class using dynamic array method.
We used it on 3 important areas like infix to postfix conversion, postfix evaluation and parenthesized expression.
We efficiently made the code by separating declarations in stack.h, definitions in stack.cpp, and execution in driver.cpp, making a smooth runable code.
The stack perfectly handled expression validation, operator precedence, and mathematical evaluations, making the solutions both robust and reusable.
